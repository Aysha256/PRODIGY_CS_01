# Caesar Cipher
This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a basic encryption method used to secure messages by shifting letters.

## What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a type of encryption where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed number down the alphabet. It's named after Julius Caesar, who used it for his private messages.

## Features

- **Encrypt** a message by shifting letters.
- **Decrypt** a message by reversing the shift.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Leaves non-alphabet characters unchanged.
